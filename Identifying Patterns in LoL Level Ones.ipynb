Every year hundreds of teams around the globe compete with the goal of winning the World Championship held every Autumn. The use of data analytics by professional teams is a rather recent development as the scene continues to grow every year. The youth of this part of the industry means there is still a significant amount of room for new technologies and research into how data can give teams an edge. \n\nThe aim of this notebook is to showcase one potential use case of data analytics based on position data of a LoL team. Data was gathered using a custom version of [this program](https://github.com/Steeeephen/loltracker), so there may be inconsistencies in the data itself. Considering the fact that this is more a proof of concept and exploration of the possibilities than in-depth statistical analysis, I'm not too concerned about the results themselves.\n\n***\n## Intro\n\n### The Premise: Level Ones\n\nWhat I'll set out to do is to use predictive modelling (Multinomial Logistic Regression) to try and compare how a given team changes their formation at the start of the game, in an attempt to find patterns that can be exploited. \n\nEach game of LoL starts with all 5 members of both teams spawning in their respective base. Each team has 5 disinct roles; Toplaner, Jungler, Midlaner, ADC and Support. They leave the base, spread out and have until the in-game clock hits 90 seconds before the first set of neutral minions spawn. This is generally referred to as the 'level one', as it occurs before any player has the chance to level up. Some teams will get creative and try to invade enemy territory to gain an advantage, but oftentimes teams will play a defensive formation and wait for the game to properly begin.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/m6HJ09B.png\" width=700/>\n\nThe goal of this model will be to think of the scenario where a team invades in a specific place at a specific time and finds an enemy player. Will they be alone? Who is it likely to be? If we specifically want to find one player and set them back at the start of the game, is there a certain way we should go about it?\n\n***\n### The Case Study: G2 Esports\n\nFor the purposes of this notebook I chose the LEC Spring Champions, G2 Esports. I gathered the data on all of their games and used that to build the models. G2 have been serial winners for the past year and a half, losing just a single tournament in that timespan (including winning Europe's first major tournament in 8 years). Most of their losses come from falling very far behind in the first ~8-10 minutes of the game, meaning any early advantages you can gain over them are especially crucial\n\n***\n### The Data: Positional Data from the Spring Season\n\nThe data consists of (x,y) coordinates along with a 'Seconds' value showing the in-game timer the datapoint was taken at. The champion played by each character is also recorded, but is not currently used in the model due to the high cardinality (nearly 150 possible champions)\n\nThe (x,y) coordinates relate to the player's position on the in-game map:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2P0mkLt.png\" width=500/>\n\n\n***\n### The Method: Probabilities of a Logistic Regression Model\n\nThe idea is to build a statistical model that takes the data in and predicts what champion is likely to be found at a given spot at a given time.\n\nThat is to say, we build a model such that the probability of a given point + time being attributed to a given role can be represented as:\n\n$$\\large Probability(Y_i = Role_{j} \\mid time_{i}, x_{i}, y_{i}) = \\frac{e^{\\beta_{j,0} + \\beta_{j,1}time_i + \\beta_{j,2}x_i + \\beta_{j,3}y_i}}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{4} e^{\\beta_{k,0} + \\beta_{k,1}time_i + \\beta_{k,2}x_i + \\beta_{k,3}y_i}}$$\n\nWe'll then build a grid that spans the map and apply our model to every point in the grid, for a given time. This will give us a list of 5 probabilities for each point on our map, one for each role. I.e. \"If someone is found at this time at this place, it is $p_{j}\\%$ likely to be role $j$\", with one probability for each role. High probability values will help us identify locations where it is almost certain to be this player, meaning the chances of finding them isolated at this time are very high\n\n***\n## Data Cleaning\n\nTo start, we read in the data and drop unnecessary columns, saving our seconds column in the process","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/lec-spring-2020-g2-esports-level-one-positions/g2redside.csv\")\n\nsecs = df['Seconds'].tolist()\ndf.drop(['Unnamed: 0','Seconds'],\n         inplace=True, \n         axis=1)\ncols = df.columns.tolist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our input data will take the form (time, x, y), while our output will simply be the corresponding role (1-5 for top-support)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = np.empty([len(secs)*df.shape[1],3])\ny = np.empty(len(secs)*df.shape[1])\n\nk = 0\nlowest = min(secs)\n\nfor i in secs:\n    for y_j, j in enumerate(df.loc[i-lowest]):\n        j = literal_eval(j.replace('(nan, nan)', '(0,0)'))\n        X[k] = [i, j[0],j[1]]\n        y[k] = y_j % 10\n        k+=1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To validate our model we'll split it into a training and testing set, as is standard","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"y = (y[[0 not in i for i in X]])\nX = (X[[0 not in i for i in X]])\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***\n## The Model\n\nNaturally there are 5 possible roles that the player could fit in, so we'll use a multinomial logistic regression.
